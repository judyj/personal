# About Me Page

## Standard blurb:
Judy has been a software engineer for over thirty-five years, and has been at [Onyx Point](https://www.onyxpoint.com/) since 2015. 
She has also functioned as a System Engineer, Project Manager, ScrumMaster, and a record store clerk. 
She was lucky enough to have started programming in the 19XXes when her Dad brought home a [PDP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-8) - she eventually progressed from paper-tape and punched cards to more modern computing systems.  
When not at work, Judy can be found baking yummy treats for family, friends, and coworkers; attending hockey games and rock concerts; or trying to finish a good book.  
Judy also loves to volunteer, especially in events that promote diversity in technology. 
Proof of her dedication to this cause is the fact that _both of her awesome daughters are engineers_

## Talks
* [Diversity in Tech 7 November 2016](https://inclusion.cs.umd.edu/events/diversity/2016#collapse-2-15) with [Amanda Arnold](https://github.com/MandyPoppins)
  * In this session we will address common barriers to success for women in technology and address issues that must be touched in order to enable cultural change (policy- pipeline- and advocacy).
  * Together with the group we will build a potential survey for employees the answers to which will provide a starting place for culture realignment planning. Attendees will be encouraged to answer their survey honestly and use it to work toward change in their corporate culture.
  * They will also identify personnel in their company who they think can help them to implement these changes. We will also talk about engagement- policy adjustments- and the importance of visibility.
  * [Slides](https://github.com/judyj/Diversity-In-Tech/blob/master/Lead%20the%20Charge.pdf)
* UMCP Flexus Classroom  17 November 2016
  * Lean In Book Discussion (Chapters 4 and 7). The Director of the Women in Engineering Program, Dr. Paige Smith, and instructor, Cinthya Salazar, will prepare some discussion questions based on the chapters assigned to this session, but it will be great if you can tie in the topics to your professional experiences. You can also come up with your own discussion questions and we can exchange them prior to the class. Depending on how many women from your organization are able to come, we can break up the class into small groups and have both large-group and small-group discussions.
